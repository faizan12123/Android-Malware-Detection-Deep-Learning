# Malware-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-97.8-accuracy-

As the Android operating system continues to grow in popularity, malware attacks on the platform evolve in complexity accordingly.
In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect whether some code is either malicious or benign.

# The Dataset


For this project I used the Drebin-215 dataset 
provided and used by the DroidFusion researchers ( https://www.sec.cs.tu-
bs.de/~danarp/drebin/index.html ). The Drebin-215 dataset has a total of 15036 samples, 
with 5560 recorded as malware and the remaining as benign. It has 215 features and 2 
classes, malware and benign.

# The accuracy

After completing my model using Keras, I was able to achieve an accuracy score of 97.8%.
